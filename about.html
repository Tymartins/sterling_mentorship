        <p>Sterling is driven to improve employee learning and development through a number of diverse mentoring programmes.</p>
        <p>Mentoring is a widely used development tool that has proved to positively impact effectiveness, confidence, and career advancement.</p>
        <p>At the heart of Mentoring in Sterling is a relationship based on trust and mutual regard, where one colleague uses their expertise and knowledge to support the development of another colleague.</p>
   
        <h2>Mentoring provides:</h2>
        <li>A safe space to explore options and plan future action</li>
        <li>A place to be challenged and supported</li>
        <li>A sounding board</li>
        <li>New perspectives</li>
        
        <h2>Foundation School Mentoring Programme</h2>
        <p>The Foundation School Mentoring Programme for Graduate Trainees matches our specially selected Entry-Level employees with Mentors, who are Senior and Experienced staff of the bank and serve as guards, guides and counsels to these mentees who do not have any experience or career exposure.</p>

        <h2>The Bloom Network Mentoring Programme</h2>
        <p>The Bloom Network was set up to improve gender balance at all decision-making levels of our organization and a key part of this initiative is establishing an impactful mentorship program to offer the required support to younger Sterling women.</p>
