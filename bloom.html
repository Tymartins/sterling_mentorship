        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>The Bloom Network is a network for Sterling Women aimed at empowering our women by supporting them to realize their full potential and ultimately drive representation in decision-making levels throughout the Bank.</p>
        <p>The Bloom Network is focused on opening up discussions relating to women's issues and identifying support on areas outlined below:</p>
        <li>To provide and share information and knowledge of Women's issues, learning and development opportunities, and leadership development.</li>
        <l>To identify opportunities for work shadowing, mentoring, and career development as appropriate.</l>
        <li>To provide peer support as appropriate.</li>
        <li>To be a consultative group to the Bank regarding issues on gender balance in relation to policies, representation at Senior & Executive Management and projects.</li>
        <li>To act as a confidential forum for debate and networking for women at Sterling Bank.</li>
        <br>

        <p>The Bloom Network was set up to improve gender balance at all decision-making levels of our organization. A key part of this initiative is to conduct impactful mentoring programmes which support younger Sterling women. The Bloom Mentoring Programme provides mentees with the benefits outlined below:</p>
        <li>Career guidance from Middle and Senior Management Female Employees</li>
        <li>Opportunities to shadow more senior female colleagues</li>
        <li>Support in terms of career progression and decision making</li>
